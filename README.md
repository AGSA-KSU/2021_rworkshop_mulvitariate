Hey there!  

This is a public GitHub repository to share the files needed for the **Kansas State University 2021 AGSA R Workshop - Multivariate analysis**, taught on April 7th and 8th 2021 by [@leombastos](https://github.com/leombastos) and [@adriancorrendo](https://github.com/adriancorrendo).    

The workshop was divided into 2 days:  
- **day 1 (Leo Bastos)**: 
    - Understanding multicollinearity  
    - Principal Component Analysis  (dimensionality reduction)
    - k-means (clustering)  

- **day 2 (Adrian Correndo)**:  
    - Conditional inference tree  
    - Random forest  
    - Training/validating/testing predictive models  

This repository contains the following sub-folders:  
- **data**: contains the data file that will be used for the analysis.  
- **markdown**: contains the R markdown files with the code for the workshop. At download, only partially filled code will be shared, with completely filled scripts shared after the workshop.  
- **output**: contains graphs outputted during the analysis.
