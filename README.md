# 2021-rworkshop-ksu  

Hey there!  

This is a public GitHub repository to share the files needed for the **Kansas State University 2021 AGSA R Workshop - Multivariate analysis**, taught on April 7th and 8th 2021 by @leombastos and @adriancorrendo.    

This repository contains the following sub-folders:  
- **data**: contains the data file that will be used for the analysis.  
- **markdown**: contains the R markdown files with the code for the workshop. At download, only partially filled code will be shared, with completely filled scripts shared after the workshop.  

## Include here an image from the analysis!
